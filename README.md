Documentation : http://github.com/back2arie/Kalkun/wiki/

## Requirements
You need to install and configure this first:
* apache 2.x.x
* PHP 7.x.x (CodeIgniter3 requires 5.6 (or at very least 5.3.6) but we suggest >=7. If you use php>=5.6 and it works, please report back so that we update the minimal requirements)
* PHP extensions:
  * mysql/pgsql/pdo_sqlite
  * session
  * hash
  * json
  * mbstring
  * APC or APCu
* PHP-CLI
* PHP Composer
* MySQL 5.1+ or PostgreSQL or SQLite3
* gammu-smsd (make sure it is already running and configured)

## Installation

1. Extract to web root folder (eg: /var/www/html => Ubuntu)
1. Run `composer install` 
1. Create database named kalkun

   For MySQL (you may do it with mysql console or phpMyAdmin)
     ```
     # mysql > CREATE DATABASE kalkun;
     # mysql > quit
     ```
   For PostgreSQL
    ```
    CREATE USER username WITH password 'password' NOCREATEDB NOCREATEROLE;
    CREATE DATABASE kalkun WITH OWNER = username;
    ```
1. Edit database config (application/config/database.php)  
   Change database value to 'kalkun'.  
   username and password depends on your database configuration.  
   If you use a specific port with PostgreSQL, you may also need to set
   `$db['default']['port'] = "5432";`

1. Import gammu database schema (it's included on gammu source, eg. `gammu/docs/sql/mysql.sql`)

    For MySQL : 
    ```
    mysql kalkun - u username -p < gammu/docs/sql/mysql.sql
    ```
    For PostgreSQL : 
    ```
    psql -U username -h localhost kalkun < gammu/docs/sql/pgsql.sql
    ```
    For PostgreSQL & debian:
    ```
    gunzip -c /usr/share/doc/gammu-smsd/examples/pgsql.sql.gz | psql -U username -h localhost kalkun
    ```
1. Configure daemon (to manage inbox and autoreply)
   -  Set path on gammu-smsd configuration at runonreceive directive, e.g:
      ```
      [smsd]
      runonreceive = /var/www/html/kalkun/scripts/daemon.sh
      ```
      or, if you use Windows:
      ```
      [smsd]
      runonreceive = C:\xampp\htdocs\kalkun\scripts\daemon.bat
      ```
   - set correct path (php-cli path and daemon.php path) on daemon.sh or daemon.bat
   - set correct path (php-cli path and outbox_queue.php path) on outbox_queue.sh or outbox_queue.bat
   - make sure that the daemon & outbox_queue scripts are executable
   - Change URI path in daemon.php & outbox_queue.php. Default is (http://localhost/kalkun)
1. Configure Kalkun
    - _There are 2 ways to configure_
        - Graphic Install (this will also check that all the dependencies are installed)  
          1. Launch http://your-location/kalkun/index.php/install, and follow instruction there
          1. Finally delete file /var/www/html/kalkun/*install* in case the installer didn't do so.
        - Manual Install 
          1. Import sql file located in kalkun/media/db/ to kalkun database.
        
             For MySQL
             ```
             mysql -u username -p kalkun < /var/www/html/kalkun/media/db/mysql_kalkun.sql
             ```
             For PostgreSQL
             ```
             psql -U username -h localhost kalkun < /var/www/html/kalkun/media/db/pgsql_kalkun.sql
             ```
           2. Delete the file /var/www/html/kalkun/*install* 
           
              `rm /var/www/html/kalkun/install`
## IMPORTANT
  * After install is finished, you need to remove install folder.
  * To improve security, it's higly recommended to change "encryption_key" in application/config/config.php

Open up your browser and go to http://your-location/kalkun

Default account for the Web Interface (you can change it after you login):  
`username = kalkun`  
`password = kalkun`

Enjoy...:)
